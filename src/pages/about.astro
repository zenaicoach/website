                            <p>ZenAI.Coach is a labor of love — an early-stage initiative that we, Sudesh and Guru, have been dreaming about for over a year. We've spent countless hours reflecting on what truly matters in life, and how we might use our skills and life experiences to help others lead more conscious, fulfilling, and balanced lives. Now, we're taking the first real steps: building the vision, forming the founding team, and navigating foundational choices — including whether to structure this as a for-profit or a non-profit, and how to serve both Spiritual But Not Religious (SBNR) and Spiritual and Religious (SAR) audiences through a universal, secular spiritual lens.</p>
                            <p>From the beginning, we've been aligned on one thing: social good is our top priority. We want to build this company in the spirit of the very wisdom we seek to share — helping everyone involved in ZenAI.Coach live a life of purpose, joy, and balance. This isn't just about building a product. It's about embodying the values we believe in, and creating something that serves humanity from the inside out.</p>
                            <p>Sudesh and I have been close friends since 1999 — walking alongside each other through life's ups and downs, reflecting often on purpose, growth, and what truly matters. ZenAI.Coach is the natural extension of those conversations — a shared vision we're now bringing to life.</p>

                        <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                            <p>I've spent much of my professional life building and scaling technology — from networking systems to edge AI cloud platforms — as a founder, technologist, and research leader. I've had the privilege of working across startups, academia, industry, and open-source communities, helping to launch platforms and movements that have shaped the future of infrastructure.</p>
                            <p>But beyond the technical path, my life has been shaped by reflection, loss, love, and growth — and a deep, enduring curiosity about what it means to live well. My lifelong interest in ancient wisdom traditions — from Advaita Vedanta to modern mindfulness — has not only helped me navigate life's challenges, but also inspired me to ask: How can this wisdom reach others in a meaningful, personalized way?</p>
                            <p>ZenAI.Coach is the answer I've been searching for — a way to combine my entrepreneurial and technological background with my deeper calling. I now see this as my life's work: helping others discover presence, purpose, and peace through a coach that brings ancient insights to modern life.</p>

                            <p>I've spent over two decades building enterprise software systems, leading engineering teams, and architecting solutions that solve real-world problems. Most recently, as CTO at Quogent, I've focused on business process management and customer-centric innovation — helping organizations operate with greater intelligence and agility.</p>
                            <p>But underneath my work in technology has always been a deeper search: a desire to understand what makes life meaningful, how we grow through challenges, and how we can live with greater presence, clarity, and compassion. Over the years, I've explored spiritual teachings and mindfulness practices that have shaped how I live, lead, and relate to others — at home, at work, and within myself.</p>
                            <p>ZenAI.Coach brings together the two threads of my life — the technical and the spiritual — into a single purpose. I believe deeply in our mission to make timeless wisdom accessible through modern tools, and I'm committed to building this platform — and this company — with integrity, heart, and service at its core.</p>
