            <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-slate-600"><strong>1 in 5 U.S. adults</strong> struggle with mental health. Globally, anxiety and depression are up <strong>25%</strong>.</p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-slate-600">Stress, anxiety, insecurities about future, loneliness and purposelessness are at record highs.</p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-slate-600"><strong>70% of employees</strong> said their sense of purpose is defined by their work, yet only <strong>18%</strong> believe they get as much purpose from work as they want.</p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-slate-600">A strong sense of meaning and purpose is correlated with better mental and physical health, including lower stress and better resilience.</p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-slate-600">Traditional solutions—therapy, life coaching, wellness apps—are falling short. Overwhelming users with content but failing to deliver authentic, long-term transformation.</p>
