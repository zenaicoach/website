                <p>ZenAI.Coach is grounded in the timeless spiritual truths found across humanity's great traditions—from Advaita Vedanta, Buddhist mindfulness, and Stoic philosophy to Christian mysticism, Sufi poetry, and Jewish and Taoist insight.</p>
                <p>These teachings transcend religion and ritual. They speak to a universal longing: to live with clarity, peace, purpose, and love.</p>
                <p>We distill this shared wisdom into personalized, secular coaching—so whether you're spiritual but not religious, or rooted in a faith tradition, you can reconnect with the essence of what all great paths teach: know yourself, be present, live fully.</p>
                <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-accent font-semibold italic">Wisdom across time, tailored to your life today.</p>
